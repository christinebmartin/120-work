# **Final Project Proposal **

## **Project**
My final project I am proposing
  1.  Turn the camera on the computer or phone
  2.  Take a picture of the object in front of the camera
  3.  Pixelate the picture
  4.  Allow the user to change the colors in the image

### SIMILAR WORK
Throughout this semester I've spent a lot of time online looking at other
coding projects.  I keep coming back to the pixelated images.
I found these pages, which are examples of capturing a picture and pixelating them:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51197572/p5js-full-window-camera-capture
  https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/454633
I have spent quite a bit of time watching Coding Train videos on YouTube as they
informative, but also explain the concepts in easy to understand ways
I have find it amazing a computer can capture an image, and modify it to create another look and feel  


## **POTENTIAL PROBLEMS**
This project goes beyond skills we've learned in the class and really pushes my creative ability
I do expect to encounter issues with using a local server, and capturing images using a local camera

## **WORK PLAN**
###  Deadline  4/24/19
1.  Get local server loaded into Atom
2.  Test local server usage to ensure it will WORK
3.  Research how to capture photos using camera
4.  Begin testing
### Deadline 4/29/19
1.  Finalize changes and submit project

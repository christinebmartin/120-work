# **Final Project  **

## **Project**
My final project
1.  Captures video from the computer or phone
2.  Pixelates the picture
3.  Randomly changes the colors of the captured photograph

### Work Completed
I spent hours upon hours watching Shiffman videos, combing through his book and doing google searches on how to get the background iamge to worked
I was able to utilize lessons learned on arrays, and random numbers
I spent quite a bit of time learning about capturing video images from the computer.  My school computer did not like turning videos on, when using Atom.  The video worked on demo websites, but not when using Atom.  I believe it may have something to do with the live server issues I was having.
Learned quite a bit about clmtrackr.  Spent several days trying to figure out how I could take an image from the computer and replace part of the face with a caricature of an animal.
Added new libraries

### Successes
Live server activated in Atom!!!  This took days
Video capture successful!  Again, something else that took days to troubleshoot and then switch computers
Able to change the look of the captured image
Able to add new library items
Completed this project on time, although spouses medical issues took over life for several weeks

##Failures
The list is almost endless
  1.  Unable to capture videos in school computers
  2.  CROS error received on work computers
  3.  Unable to get background image to load with captured camera image to make a picture like a photo booth
  4.  Unable to get input box to function so that a user could change the pixels
  5.  Tried using clmtrackr to replace a portion of captured image with a caricature
  6.  Tried using clmtrackr to warp a captured image
  7.  Erroneously added libraries, which caused large errors, causing the libraries to be rebuilt
  8.  School computer crashed two days before deadline.  Had to load Atom on work computer.

###Lessons learned
1.  I planned for this project, but do not feel the planning was enough.  Needed to spend more time mapping out the design and how it could be accomplished before coding began
2.  Don't make things so complicated!
3.  Don't take three classes when working full-time and traveling each weeks
4.  Ask for assistance on issues encountered
5.  Save work often!!!

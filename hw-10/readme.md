# **WEEK OF March 15, 2019  - March 21, 2019 **

## **SUMMARY OF WORK COMPLETED**
Completed additional research and reading on loops, arrays and functions
Watched a lot videos and read a lot on loops, arrays and functions
Learned about Sprites and Spritesheets
Found a website that would breakdown the Spritesheet into multiple png files
Updated the P5_lib to accomodate for sprites in the drawing
Researched how to add text


### STEPS TAKEN TO COMPLETE TASKS
Created an array of various words
Created a function where a flower was drawn.
The flower function was then called in the draw function
Created a sprite using multiple images
Inserted the sprite to animate my stick man walking across the screen


## **PROBLEMS OR ISSUES**
Can't figure out how to make my walking man stop at the end of the screen and start over again since the drawSprite function has to be at the end

## **ITEMS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION**


## **ISSUES ASSISTED WITH**
None

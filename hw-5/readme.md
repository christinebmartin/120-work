# **WEEK OF February 9 - February 14**

## **SUMMARY OF WORK COMPLETED**
- Explored and experimented with animation motion in lesson, and also in _Make: Getting Started with p5.js_
- Researched and studied online P5.js animation projects others have completed
- Spent considerable amount of time in Workspace testing various animation functions
- Added waving to self portrait using rotation function
- Completed README.md
- Becoming more comfortable with translate feature.  May consider redoing self portrait to utilize translate() function
- Researched ability to change image based on time lapsed

### STEPS TAKEN TO COMPLETE TASKS
1.  Created new directory, labeled hw-5/
2.  Copied week 4 project into newly created directory to add features to self portrait
3.  Opened sketch.js and began experimenting, saving after each section change, or more often, to view changes
4.  Played with the timing of when an image should changes
5.  Play, play, play with code

## **PROBLEMS OR ISSUES**
1.  Struggled with adding the animation horizontally
2.  Considered using Sprite() functions, and found I could not get it to work
3.  Still a bit fuzzy on using Width and Height, but sure it will become more clear as it's used more

## **ITEMS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION**
1.  How to use Sprite functions

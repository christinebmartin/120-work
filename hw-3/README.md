### STEPS TAKEN TO COMPLETE TASKS
 - To correct my image issue from week2, I saved my image to my University of Montana box, and then embedded the URL in the week 2 README.md file
 - To add comments on a line, each line began with "//".  To add block comments, line began with "/*" and when comments were completed, ended with "*/"
 - Using the "function setup()" and "background" functions different color backgrounds were practiced
   - Adding the "createcanvas()" function, size of backgrounds were practiced
  - Adding to the canvas text was added using the "draw()" function, allowing the first Hello World! to be created
  - Within GitHub settings page, my GitHub webpage was published, see above link

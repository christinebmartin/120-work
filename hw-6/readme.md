# **WEEK OF February 15 - February 21**

## **SUMMARY OF WORK COMPLETED**
Completed study of lessons in week 6
Downloaded e-book Make Your Own Algorithmic Martin
Watch a ridiculous number of Coding Train videos on YouTube
Played, played, failed, played and played some more
Downloaded an object file and attempted to have it create dots at vertices.  This took WAY too long and was scrapped, although it was quite cool and very close to working.

### STEPS TAKEN TO COMPLETE TASKS
Copied HW-5 directory to new directory labeled HW-6
Deleted all code in sketch.js from week 5


## **PROBLEMS OR ISSUES**
This was the most confusing week so far! I don't even know where to start
The lesson seems so random and jumped into details that are far more complex than prior 5 weeks
Not grasping how to use Modulo in drawing

## **ITEMS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION**
Still need to learn more about when to use math functions in drawing.
Just about everything

## **ISSUES ASSISTED WITH**
None

# **WEEK OF JANUARY 17 - JANUARY 23**
## **SUMMARY OF WORK COMPLETED**
- Completed homework from week 1
- Install Github Desktop
- Create Git.com account
- Synch Github Desktop with Github
- Install text editor, Atom
- Practiced editing documents, commenting on edits, and committing changes
### STEPS TAKEN TO COMPLETE TASKS
  1. Follow the fantastic instructions provided in the weekly lesson
## **PROBLEMS OR ISSUES**
The only problems encountered this week were simply catching up.  I registered for this class late in the day on Friday, January 18th and the class did not become available to me until late Sunday, January 20th.  I've spent a good part of the week acclimating myself with the course, completing the activities from week 1 and working as quickly as possible on week 2 reading and activities.
The only issue I'm having currently is around Command Prompt commands.  I find myself completing google searches for them and bookmarking the pages for future reference.
No posts were made about the cathc up work as the problem is not technical in nature.
[Issue 213](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding/issues/213) was created requesting information on list of top commands used, in the hopes of minimizing the amount of time spent in the future searching for commands.
No feedback has been received to date, however the Issue was created late in the day on January 23rd.
## **ITEMS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION**
1. There is still some confusion on my part as to which programs (i.e. Atom or Github) that should be used for specific tasks.
  - I believe this will become more clear as I continue to acclimate myself to this class rather than playing catchup.
## **ISSUES ASSISTED WTIH**
I have not assisted with any issues this week as I have been in this class for less than a full week.
My goal in the next week is to review issues posted and begin answering and learning from them.
